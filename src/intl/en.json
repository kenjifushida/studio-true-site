        "desc": "Through design, we aim to create a community that can survive in a complex and diverse society. We feel that it is difficult to live in this society. However, we believe that we can survive in this society as a community by facing the problems that lie ahead of us one by one with our friends. We believe that community is solidarity with others, which is important for surviving in society together, and is a network of activities that can change that society. We will create communities in various places in the world, collaborate with many others from our unique approach, and develop actions to improve society.",
